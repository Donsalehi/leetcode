[442. Find All Duplicates in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/)

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears **at most** **twice**, return *an array of all the integers that appears **twice***.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses only *constant* auxiliary space, excluding the space needed to store the output.
